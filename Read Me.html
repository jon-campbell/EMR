Laying ruin to space resorts, destroying outposts,capturing starships and viciously raging war on entire planets, the pirates showedno mercy. Earth's high-tech Marine defense force were decimated by the onslaughtof these alien warriors. The forces of the pirates seemed unstoppable, and mankind'svery survival hung in the balance. At the helm of El Diablo were the fiercest ofthe alien forces. Adorned in blue garments and wicked by nature, these pirate leaderswere soon given the nickname of </FONT><A HREF="http://bighouse.bungie.org/devil/story.html"><FONTFACE="Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, Arial">Devil in a Blue Dress</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, Arial">.<BR><BR>Then stepped in one super marine to infiltrate the pirate attacks. Rescuing resortsand outposts, winning battles against unthinkable odds, solving mind boggling puzzles,and conquering the pirate home world, one brave marine managed to save the galaxyfrom a most horrible demise and end the reign of the Devil in a Blue Dress. For atime, it seemed that this bloody interruption of human civilization had come to aclose.<BR><BR>But wait! What's this? Discovered on the pirate home world during the cleanup missionare artifacts of unknown origin, strange devices and eerie potions that leave manyquestions unanswered. No one seemed to understand what these discoveries meant ...no one except the artificial intelligence known as Merlin. As Merlin unravels themysteries and reveals surprising information about his own existence, our brave marinebegins to realize that the real battle has not yet begun.<BR><BR>From the bowels of evil rises the most powerful foe to challenge you yet: the cunninglymalevolent sorceress Morgana. Rising to power during the period of Camelot, she discoversa means to travel through time. Conjuring the darkness out of most every creatureshe encounters, she begins to build empires on her trek through time. Morgana hasa diabolical plan and you may be the only chance we have to stop her!<BR><BR>You will begin your journey in the sickbay of the Federation starship called Kronos,an advanced exploration craft conducting experimentation with new time travel technology.Once reunited with Merlin, you will learn more about the adventures to follow, andthe forces which you must overcome. </FONT></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FF0000" FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, Arial"><B>Welcometo Excalibur: Morgana's Revenge!</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, Arial"><BR></FONT><HR><FONT FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, Arial"><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, Arial"><B>New Engine:</B><BR></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica, Arial">EMR 3.0 is based upon the AlephOneengine.
