WorldSoft Security has been disabled!

There is no guarantee that Morgana does not have a backup protocol... or two... but the WorldSoft grid which you just shut down is the primary security system in the area.  

Locate the maintenance drop at the far end of the plaza.  This is your gateway to Morgana's headquarters.  Make your way through the maintenance tunnels below the streets, and penetrate the headquarters building by way of the maintenance elevator.  Battle your way to the top, destroying as many devices and enemy forces as you are able.  

I will try to contact you from within the building with new information as to Morgana's whereabouts.

In one way at least, it seems fate shall work in our favor.  Just outside the security control building is a helipad.  Though WorldSoft's security measures are quite advanced, keeping this helipad open makes it possible to teleport supplies down to you.  

Further, although nearby Federation forces have no men to spare, I've spoken with an old friend of mine.  After fully appreciating
the importance and difficulty of the task at hand, he has offered a 
squad of Federation marines to assist you.  They are under orders to stay near the helipad so that they may teleport back after clearing the area.
