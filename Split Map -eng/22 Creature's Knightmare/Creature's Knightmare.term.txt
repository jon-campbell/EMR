   $C1Welcome to my nightmare. There are no magic potions to save you here. No great green glowing crystals to point your way out. You are on your own.

   Kill, or be killed. All else is pointless.

   $C1   But then, you like killing.

           Don't you?

    Have you found Morgana's Stairs?  It is not necessary for solving the Creature's nightmare, but it could serve you well to envision your nemesis before battle.  

You can find the stairs northwest of here.  

Go and gaze at the future.

    Creature! Go to your room. 

    Our hero has work to do. Leave 
    him alone.

    Praise be to the heavens, I have found you.

    The Creature will not bother you again. He won't be invading any more of your dreams. He is cooling his pixels in an empty potion jar.

    The situation on Kronos grows worse and Merlin wishes you to invade the Temple of the Black Knights. I will try and help you within the temple with a potion or two and some instructions on how to find your way around. I was there once as a very young woman and I remember there is a secret to the star patterns on the floors.  

    Awake, fearless warrior. 

    Walk into the stars.

     Still looking for the way out? Just like the old days isn't it. You, me and the bad guys. 

     If you wander around here you will find some ammo, and maybe a hint as to how to get out of this place. Then again, you may just run into another pack of archers.

    Have you found Morgana's Stairs?  It is not necessary for solving the Creature's nightmare, but it could serve you well to envision your nemesis before battle.  

You can find the stairs due east of here.  

Go and gaze at the future.

    Do you realize how close you are to the exit? I doubt it or you wouldn't be standing here. 

    Too close I think. Time for another trip.
