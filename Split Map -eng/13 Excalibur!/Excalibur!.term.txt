INCOMING MESSAGE FROM MERLIN...

While you were battling Morgana's forces, I have been engaged in experimentation with a higher level of communication.  I believe I have discovered a means to reach beyond the technology of Kronos future pods.  I am not certain where the signals are coming from, but I suspect it is from this time period.  Mysticism has taken root in the future, and I am now able to travel outside the computer in spirit form.  I will use this to our advantage as I try to convince the sorcerers to favor you.

Your task is to explore Camelot...
#PICT 11302

Here in this gathering hall, Arthur's knights once met on a regular basis.  Victories were celebrated, and stories of chivalry were shared.  The camaraderie of human spirit has never reached as high as in the days of Camelot.  

It is the table of true knighthood, of bravery, of strength, of honor; nay, but most of all, it is the table of truth.  

For just as it was truth that built the likes of Camelot and the Round Table...
#PICT 11303


... it was deceit that tore it down.

From the lies that Morgana spread, to the lies that even great men find themselves trapped in during times of comfort, evil grew strong, and goodness faded.

With a deadly blow, Camelot was swallowed up by this evil.

Blast!  How many times I warned Arthur!  

Let us not suffer this tragedy in vain,  for his spirit still lives, as does the spirit of all good men.  Do not forget the lesson: Beware of evil.  Always!  For it strikes most often from places you least expect.
#PICT 11301

In the halls of Camelot, in the veins of these castle walls, beats the heart of the sword of power: Excalibur.  From the enchanted waters, Excalibur will rise again.  

Only one who is of true spirit can free Excalibur from the waters which hold it.  Let your heart be true, and the Lady of the Lake shall reward you with the sword.

Do not be careless, however, for as certain as the sword will rise, so too will the shadow sorcerers of Morgana's minions be guarding its waters.  Although the sword is infinitely beyond their grasp, they have dedicated their lives to keeping it out of the reach of all others.
#CHECKPOINT 1



Excalibur derives its strength from the enchanted waters of this land.  To use Excalibur effectively, you need enchanted water.  Several vials of enchanted water can be found resting on top of the Round Table.
#PICT 11300


While you explore Camelot, try to clear the castle of as many enemies as you can.  Winning back the castle will persuade the Sorcerers' Guild to side with us.  Before leaving, be sure to retrieve Excalibur, and locate the scrolls of Camelot.  

Your exit from Camelot is embedded in the Crystal Room.

But I cannot send you forth without you first obtaining the sword of power, Excalibur.  You know where it is, now go get it.

$C4SAO 71292541 is a small red dwarf star of exact mass unknown. While gravitometric analysis suggests between 0.26 and 0.45 solar masses, stellar absolute magnitude is uncharacteristically low for a star of that size in that mass range. Analysis suggests a large cloud of debris and low-temperature gasses are scattering the light to a previously-unrivaled extent.
#INFORMATION
$C4Spectral analysis of this dust cloud indicates unusual levels of Actinium decay spectra.

As the estimated age of this dwarf star is 1.53 billion years, there is significant evidence of clumping of matter in the debris field surrounding the star, including circumstantial evidence of at least one planetary body radius (1000-1500 km) within 20 million kilometers of the star, in a slightly elliptical orbit.

During allotted observation time, there were 62 instances of modulated tachyon pulses. Probabilistic analysis indicates this is most likely the result of large traffic levels of warp-capable vehicles of unknown advanced warp propulsion design.

You have fought gallantly and beaten back the forces which had once held Camelot.  This feat will help greatly in winning the sorcerers to our side.  There are those in the guild who still hold out against you.  I am certain that they represent the minority.  Many of the sorcerers have confided to me that they follow these rogue leaders out of fear, not respect.  I will report more on this subject later.
#INFORMATION

Given the battles you have fought, it is time for you to rest. You must prepare for an all out war on the wicked archers of the Dark Forest.  I will now prepare the sleep chamber for you.

Access to the sleep chamber is shielded with magic bars.  This precaution is taken to ensure that you do not leave without Excalibur.  It is the magic of the sword which will gain you access to the chamber.

Upon awakening from the sleep chamber, your next challenge will be to explore the Dark Forest, discover the stronghold of the evil archers, and eradicate them in battle.  There is no other way to break the spell which Morgana has placed on them.

I cannot send you forth without the sword of power, Excalibur.  It is crucial for future missions!    

Although you have gained much wisdom by way of magical scrolls, you still have not paid a visit to the Round Table.  This is a spiritual room, and experiencing it firsthand enriches the soul.  Every advantage helps!  

If you are low on enchanted water, you may find a number of extra water vials there as well.

Search for the two scrolls of Camelot, then approach the Round Table with care.  A successful campaign will land you with a good supply of enchanted water vials, a crucial drink for the sword of power.
