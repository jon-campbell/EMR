$C5Initializing Greeting...

$C4   I am the artificial intelligence
   recently installed into Kronos. I am
   known as Marcel 29.2A.  

   The database served by the AI before
   me is quite extensive and will take 
   some time to incorporate into my
   configuration.  

   Preliminary archive scans indicate 
   that you have had yourself quite an
   adventure.  Welcome back to Kronos.

$C5Status
$C0 $C4  The ship is currently undergoing 
   cleanup from the preceding battle 
   which took place here.  All systems 
   are secure, but many areas are in 
   need of repairs. Lock-down protocol
   is in effect in several areas.
$C0
$C5Instructions
$C4   The Holodeck suite on Deck 11 has 
   been pre-programmed for you. Merlin, 
   the previous AI on Kronos, has routed
   instructions to Engineering.  Due to
   security protocol, access to this data
   can only be retrieved from Engineering.

$C5Note of Disapproval
$C4   Reports indicate you abandoned a help-
   less A.I. in an hour of peril.  $C0

My old buddy Merlin!  I guess he was here before Marcel.  That is so much better, I can really give you an idea of what's going on on board this ship.  Looks like we are aboard the Federation Kronos.  

Scanning... 

So it appears there was a huge battle here, but the ship is secure. Repairs are underway to get this ship... well... shipshape!  

Hey, Lock-down is in effect in several areas... hmmm... 

I think you're trying to strand me on this ship.  

You better get a move on.

$C0Local Engineering functionality has been restored.  What would you do without me?  I'm not just an AI, I'm an Engineer.  Well Mr. Cranky, I'll have you ready for warp speed soon enough... my protocol instructs me to overestimate, then do it in 1/3 of the time... how can I keep my reputation as a miracle AI?

Navigation is feeding me some information for you... This ship is currently 2.8 light years from Earth.  Why are we going back there?  I think that's just trouble... I guess you'll need to fill up on some greenhouse gases to get this thing running in tip-top shape.
#INFORMATION

Now don't touch anything... we can't get this trip underway until you check out Holodecks 8-10... These holodeck programs appear to be gifts from Merlin, but my review shows that they were programmed in haste.  

I've created an alternate holodeck program for Holodeck 8.  You can choose between mine or Merlin's.  Try one, try the other, try them both!

By the way, we don't navigate from Engineering... so you'll have to get your bipedal self to the main bridge.

$C0Hey!

You!

Are you sure you want to do this?  I've reviewed the programming of this holodeck.  I respect Merlin's efforts to actually judge your accuracy, but raptors?  According to your log entries, you've already shot quite a few of these creatures.  Isn't this a bit excessive?

I put together a program that I think you might find a little more interesting.  Flip the switch to activate the alternate programming.

$C0Good move! 

Now see what a really good holodeck programmer can do for you.  I hope you like popcorn, because there is going to be a lot of popping action going on in here.  I've integrated a couple of bots in this program to give you some challenge going after the Forraje clones.  

In the blue corner, we have Tiny Bot (Play_sound {"Crowd Cheer"}), and in the red corner, we have Marcel Bot (Play_sound {"Unhappy Crowd"}). I considered calling this program "Popclones", but decided to stay conservative for my corporate sponsors...

$C0It looks like a midway, or something of that nature, but with guns and goo.  

It also looks like Merlin's programming was inspired by toxic waste?  

Toxic waste of the mind, maybe.  

Oh!  I didn't say that!  Someone must be hacking into the system.  Yeah, that's it.

Goo is sticky and smelly.  Toxic goo is just like it, only worse.

If E=MC Squared, then I do believe that all warp engines are fully operational!  Let's see the Lost in Space robot do that!  The Navigation subsystem reports that we are currently 2.8 light years from that mostly dihydrogen oxide covered planet.  It appears that I cannot activate the helm until you complete your exploration of all the holodecks.  Merlin's vanity at work.  

Once you've visited each of the holodecks, come back and it will be full speed ahead.  I can't wait to say "Engage!"  Wasn't Picard the best?

Yo, Marcel! 

Engage! 

Make it so!

Nobody ever listens to me.  

Looks like Marcel won't engage until you are in stasis, the handy little travel bed that makes the trip seem a lot faster than it really is.
