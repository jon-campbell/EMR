INCOMING MESSAGE FROM MERLIN...
$C0
Your temporal conversion signal was intercepted during transmission from Kronos, and Morgana tracked the signal to your initial destination.  I am going to attempt to teleport you to a remote site on the planet in order to avoid further confrontation.  Believe me, you are not ready to do battle with her.  Morgana's immediate intention is to destroy this pod, and everything in it!  Prepare to be teleported to another location...

That was close!

You have escaped Morgana for the time being, but the Future Pod you just arrived from (station #42) has been completely destroyed.  Sensor readings show that we are in an extremely unstable area, and this pod has already undergone severe dam&9$(~~

$C3The pods are not handling this environment as well as I had hoped.  Although this pod has been torn by the chasm behind you, the shield recharger across the lava is fully functional. 

Press $C0<ESC>$C3 if you wish to explore this area further, or read on if you prefer to transport now.

$C3As you know, Morgana is searching for a rare green crystal called$C0 $BActinium$b.  $C3These crystals were scarce during the time of Camelot, and nearly impossible to find during your time period.  


Actinium Crystals have special powers which were sometimes used by sorcerers for distorting light and visual reality.  Morgana has discovered that the crystals possess far more power than known by man.  It is unclear exactly how she intends to use this power, but make no mistake; she is sure to use it for evil.
#INFORMATION


$C3I will now teleport you back near the location where your started your Jurassic journey.  There is a cavern there which contains a magnificent cluster of Actinium Crystals.  You must locate these crystals before Morgana does, and destroy the passageway which leads to them.
