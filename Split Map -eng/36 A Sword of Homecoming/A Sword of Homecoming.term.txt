$C4Welcome home Commander.  We hope your stay here at Fleet Headquarters has not been too much of an inconvenience. I apologize for the long and tedious interviews we put your through over the last week, but as you might ascertain, it is of the utmost importance that we collect and archive as much intelligence as possible to thwart any future attacks through the space-time continuum. 

The weapons and ammunition left over from your adventures have been collected and stored into the anti-contamination chambers in this building.  Our scientists will be inspecting them to explore the effects of time travel.

The AI Merlin left instructions on the criticality of returning the sword, Excalibur, to its proper time period.  We have therefore programmed the computer lab's teleporter to send you on one last journey through time.  Take Excalibur and return it to Avalon.  Once this task is complete, you will be granted access to the upper floors, where you may proceed to the roof.  We are having a helicopter flown in to take you home.  

$I- Admiral Lance T. Johnston

$C0This message was recorded and programmed into your HUD, to be activated once you approached the waters of Avalon.  During your return trip on Kronos, I began the process of re-materializing.  I shall need your help in completing the transformation.  My energy and essence were severed from the electronic state in which I have existed for the last few years.  I have re-entered my frozen body that lay in the ice caverns below Avalon.  With your help, I shall awaken and begin my transformation back into a living being.

I need you to perform three tasks here on Avalon.
#PICT 11001
Excalibur has served you well, but it is time to return her to the enchanted waters of Avalon.  There she will rest, quietly in the still waters of Avalon.  

This is the first of your three tasks.  Once Excalibur is received by the lake, my being shall begin transformation back into the living flesh.  You may witness my materialization in the cottage near the lake.

Be sure to toss the sword into the deepest waters of the lake.  Only then will the Lady of the Lake receive it. 

Seek me at the cottage for further instructions.

One day, Excalibur shall rise again, and a new hero will wield her in battle.  Until that day comes, the sword shall rest in the arms of the Dragon.

My transformation has begun.  Your next task is to seek out the Crystal of Enlightenment.  This magical sphere holds a special energy.  In the presence of this crystal, those of good spirit are enchanted with its energy.  Those of bad spirit are destroyed.  Enter the chamber in good faith, then return to the cottage once enchanted.  The energy charge will further my transformation into the flesh.

Return to me upon completion of this second task.

$C4My transformation is nearly complete.  I have been freed from the frozen curse that Morgana cast on me so many years ago.  

There is a special magical staff in the Hall of Avalon.  The key to the hall is kept in the chamber of the Lady of the Lake.  Retrieve the key to unlock the Hall, then obtain the staff.  Use the staff to cast the Shadow of Life onto the ethereal being before you.  This final spell shall complete my transformation.

The staff will not work until the Lady of the Lake has received Excalibur, and that may take some time.  Once the sword descends, that is when you may use the Staff of Life.  If all goes well, my next communication with you will be from the living Merlin.

For you, my friend, my gratitude is eternal.

Take this. It will return you to your own time.  You are returning as a hero, having freed mankind from the evil clutches of Morgana's dark magic.  Always look back on these times with great pride; and remember, always remember... for it is the doom of man that he should forget.

Understand that evil is never really destroyed, only laid dormant, waiting for opportunities.  Follow the path of true knighthood and continue to fight the evil which arises from the seeds of darkness.  Live by the truth, and the power of Excalibur will always shine from within you.

It has been an honor, brave knight.

EMR 3.0 for Aleph One was a major upgrade to EMR 2.0 for Infinity, and couldn't have been done without the hard work of several people.  Please spend a few moments in the library to explore the magic behind EMR.

Several of the developers, such as Alexei, Gregory, James, and Solra, responded to direct requests that allowed some critical features in EMR.

EMR first hit the Marathon scene in 1997 when the MMMG released EMR 1.0.  Without this beginning, there probably would have never been an EMR 2 or EMR 3.

This kiosk pays homage to the original EMR contributors.

$C3Excalibur: Morgana's Revenge has been a true labor of love.  This scenario came together from persistent effort and countless late nights of laboring on maps, graphics, physics, sounds, music, Lua, and MML.  All the while, fighting countless limitations and bugs in the game editors.

EMR has been quite a journey, from the early Marathon days when it was such a thrill to be able to create our own maps, through the Marathon Infinity days of Anvil and Forge, and up to the Aleph One engine with all of its cool new features.  What has always amazed me the most, however, is the tremendous amount of creative help generously offered from the Marathon community, from across the US to around the world.  The people involved in this scenario are awesome.

From his web biography:

  $I "When I was younger, I would go 
    into the hills at night and talk 
    quite seriously to the moon, or 
    write impossibly righteous songs 
    which put the world to rights."

Hello? Testing... Wun... Wun... Wun Choo... Wun Choo... OK?

OK. Excuse me for interrupting - quiet in the horn section please -   
this studio is costing an arm and a leg, we're over budget, we've still to record the final overture and that bloody fiddle player has gone missing! So, has anyone seen the annoying Scottish $%*^!? He was last seen chatting to a rather delightfully put together extra with a very short skirt and a very long bow.

Can I have some volunteers to track him down please? Yes - the double bass, Fraser? OK. The percussion guy... yes you. Andy. Right. One more, OK the singer with the hair. Rory? Sorry - Ruaridh. Right, that's three of you. You've got ten minutes to find the bugger, grab him by his sound post and GET HIM BACK HERE!

Red light in ten minutes everyone. Thank you.

$C4$INever say never.  Don't ever say no to a reasonable invitation to do something that might be fun. 

The greatest enjoyment I had playing Marathon was the unfolding story that revealed itself starting in Marathon 1, continuing throughout M2 and left open in M3... and seeing the game really explode visually with the amazing artwork by Craig Mullins, that stoked my desire to explore that world with the tools that were released with Marathon Infinity.

Many thanks to those folks that inspired me to stick it out and add to the expanding universe. I hope you share that excitement with our adventure.

Imbria looked at me, seeing what I was doing, and laughed.

"Is there a single one of those glowing boxes on which you haven't placed the record of that brave knight's adventure with Merlin and Morgana?"

I replied with a smile, "I was privileged and proud to be part of the team that recorded that tale. Besides, my job is to repair and improve these people's machines, and placing EMR upon them is always an improvement!"

$C4$IIn this adventure, no doubt you've seen majestic sceneries, fought scary adversaries, evaded devious traps, listened to soothing or edgy music and read intricate pieces of storylines.  Many people contributed their artistic, literary or architectural talents to this effort.

No matter how hard I try, my sceneries are never majestic, my monsters never scary, my traps never devious, and my music never soothing.  However, I did write programs and tools to empower those with talents and to enable them to create even bolder adventures like EMR. 

To every wizard his wand.  And they all need a wandmaker.
