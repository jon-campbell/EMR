$C3Ceridwen Speaks


I see you decided to take another nap.  Good thing, too.  You will awake far stronger than when you chose to sleep. 
I have much to share with you. 


This is a very strange reality. The Creature says it is from your subconscious, but I think it is his creation.

To find my secrets and learn the sacred knowledge, 

     Follow the path.

     Follow the arrows.

$C3Do you not think that sometimes you know what is about to happen?

Do you not see Morgana as she plots your demise?

Do you not know the ultimate outcome?

Hold Excalibur high above your head, close your eyes and you will see, it will all come to pass, it will all be.

     Burning with fire.



And this time, stay away from the fish.

$C3While you were off following your dreams, I  created a magical spell to help protect you in your battle with Morgana. 


Find this place.



The spell and potions will make you feel disoriented and perhaps a little dizzy, so be extremely careful.

I have left a little gift for you too.

In the pump house pool.





$C3I would be very wary of any gifts that the Creature comes bearing.

Merlin would not have chosen you for this task had he not thought you possessed at least a bit of The Sight. With training you will be able to see beyond this time and place. Or perhaps just dream beyond this time. 

Look into the crystals. They may give you visions of things to come.
