The weapon revolutionized			early hunting methods by enabling the hunter to kill from a distance. The ancient			Egyptians were the first people to use the bow and arrow extensively. They used the			weapon for hunting and in war as early as 5000 B.C. Other cultures known to use the			bow and arrow included the Assyrians and the Persians.<BR>			<BR>			By the A.D. 900's, the Turks had developed advanced archery equipment. They used			laminated bows made of a combination of wood and animal horns and tendons. The tips			of their bows curved outward like modern recurve bows. By the 1100's, the crossbow			had become a popular weapon in Europe.<BR>			<BR>			In 1337, around the time of the Hundred Years' War, the longbow ranked as the chief			weapon of the English Army. Years later, the straight bow mimicked the graceful design			of the longbow. In 1346, amidst the Battle of Crecy, 7,000 English archers routed			a much larger French force that included more than 1,000 armor-clad knights. In 1415,			during the Battle of Agincourt, about 6,000 English troops armed with longbows defeated			a French force that numbered anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000.<BR>			<BR>			The bow and arrow is a primitive, yet effective, weapon. The bow is shaped in an			arc and holds a string, or bowstring, taught from one end to the other. The user			places an arrow at the middle of the bowstring and draws the string back, bending			the bow. When released, the arrow leaves the bow at a high rate of speed. The arrow			has a maximum range of approximatley 80 yards.<BR>			<BR>			Since your shielding was designed to defend against modern, technologically advanced			weapons, it is not extremely effective against arrows. For this reason, you should			treat any enemy you encounter with a bow and arrow with extreme caution. Arrows fly			fast, and you'll need to move quickly to avoid being hit by them.<BR>			<BR>			The crossbow is also useful in firing poison bolts, when poison bolts are available.</FONT>			</BLOCKQUOTE>		</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="150">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="140">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="100">&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR></FONT><A HREF="weapons.html"><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR>INDEX</FONT></A><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#BBBBBB" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Copyright&copy; 2000-2007, ExcaliburWorld Software</FONT></BODY></HTML>
