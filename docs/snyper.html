Gaussian acceleration takes the principle of linear particle accelerators			and applies it to large masses of matter. While the magnetic field in a typical linear			accelerator has a sustained strength of around 50,000 gauss, the fields used in gaussian			acceleration only last for microseconds, but reach strengths upwards of 180 Ggauss			(180,000,000,000,000 gauss ). Acceleration is achieved through what are known as			&quot;floater coils&quot;. Each pair of coils emits a magnetic charge. The charge			alternates between pairs. As the bullet travels through a pair, it accelerates. In			between pairs, the bullet is coasting. As the bullet travels through each successive			coil, its velocity increases dramatically. By the time the bullet leaves the barrel			of the weapon, it is traveling at an approximate velocity of 7,500 feet per second.<BR>			<BR>			Gaussian acceleration technology is used in other weapons as well. The speed at which			the projectile is expelled from the weapon is increased proportionally as the distance			is lengthened from the proximal to the distal end of the barrel. Therefore, it is			an extremely effective long range weapon used in high powered sniper rifles and anti-missile			batteries. Projectiles of nearly any type can be used. The one requirement is that			it must be impregnated with Deuterium, which is the element that undergoes the majority			of the projectile's acceleration, essentially dragging the remaining matter with			it.<BR>			</FONT><TT><BR>			</TT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Snyper is the			latest in a long line of distinctive weaponry developed for the UEFC Marines by LockMart-Boeing-DuPont.			It's heritage includes the famous &quot;Long Arrow&quot; sniper's rifle and the feared			Damocles anti-armor rail gun. The DT Snyper was named after the man who invented			gaussian acceleration, Derrick &quot;The Twist&quot; Trimble. <BR>			<BR>			The gauss sidearm, of which the Snyper is a derivative, uses gaussian acceleration			to achieve speeds and forces greater than would be possible with standard explosive			ammunition. The design criteria for the Snyper was to create a weapon that exceeded			the gauss's range, velocity and potency. In addition, it needed to be at least 20%			lighter than the gauss. The designers at LockMart-Boeing-DuPont decided to use the			gauss as a base to work from. The shape of the gun is nearly identical to that of			the gauss. The only visible difference is a slightly longer barrel and beefier grip.			Inside, the weapon has undergone many improvements, eliminating the problem with			loss of energy when firing multiple rounds and improving the effectiveness of the			exponential balancing mechanism. These improvements help the user keep the gun aimed			directly at the same target, round after round. In order to achieve all of the requirements			set forth in the design criteria, special composite metals and polymers were used			to increase the stiffness and decrease the weight of the weapon. <BR>			<BR>			Due to its lightweight, each marine is issued two Snyper sidearms. While one Snyper			is deadly on its own, two Snypers can rain such a barrage of bullets with such great			accuracy that the force far exceeds that of the Damocles anti-armor rail gun. The			Snyper is an enhanced version of the standard issue marine gauss sidearm, specifically			engineered for precision. All the benefits of the gauss still exist; exponential			balancing mechanism, recoil suppression, and a beautiful design. However, this revision			overcomes some of the gauss' shortcomings. The composite polymers and metals that			are used in the Snyper give it an excellent balance between durability and efficiency.			Due to the short supply of raw materials needed for this weapon, the Snyper is reserved			for Federation troops and government assassins. The Snyper is probably the best sidearm			ever developed.</FONT>			</BLOCKQUOTE>		</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="150">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="140">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="100">&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR></FONT><A HREF="weapons.html"><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR>INDEX</FONT></A><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#BBBBBB" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Copyright&copy; 2000-2007, ExcaliburWorld Software</FONT></BODY></HTML>
