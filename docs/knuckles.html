They were considered more convenient			than weapons such as guns and knives, quieter, less messy, and often much less expensive.			However, they were considered an ugly weapon by the common citizen who still preferred			handguns and rifles.<BR>			<BR>			During the hightech revolution of the 21st century, the advances made in modern weaponry			significantly increased. The new weapons had much greater power, but required ammunition			that consisted of rare minerals and materials. Before long the ammunition required			by these new weapons out-priced the weapons themselves. <BR>			<BR>			As older weapons became defunct, it actually became too expensive to utilize the			newer weapons. The exceptions were weapons that did not require ammunition. Brass			knuckles became one such weapon, and its popularity grew. Advances were made in platinum			processing, which led to the invention of the platinum knuckles. The Federation than			introduced the dual knuckle blades, sharpened on the inside making it safer for the			owner, but deadly for his opponent.  Much more powerful and durable than its predecessor,			it was not long before they became standard issue for all Federation troops.</FONT>			</BLOCKQUOTE>		</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="150">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="140">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="100">&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR></FONT><A HREF="weapons.html"><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR>INDEX</FONT></A><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#BBBBBB" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Copyright&copy; 2000-2007, ExcaliburWorld Software</FONT></BODY></HTML>
