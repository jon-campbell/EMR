The first flashback reflects a time of peace and prosperity in	Arthur's kingdom, a time before Morgana took her revenge. Kirin, champion archer	of the Enchanted Forest, has a nightmare of Morgana attacking Camelot. As she awakes,	the nightmare becomes reality. Morgana, Mordred and Mauvair, the Treacherous Trio,	launch an all-out assault on Arthur and his kingdom. The climax of the battle is	the massacre which occurs at the Mannehaum stronghold near the base of the mountain	upon which Camelot stands. The second flashback reflects the horrors of this massacre,	where each knight, archer and sorcerer are brutally put to death. <BR>	<BR>	Mercy is not an option.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Mission</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The adventure begins as Merlin	reveals his true identity. Merlin of Camelot, sorcerer and friend to King Arthur,	is one in the same with the AI Merlin that guided our brave marine through the battles	against the space pirates in Devil in a Blue Dress. Merlin tells the story of Morgana's	revenge, her rise to power, and the increasing threat she poses to mankind with her	newly found, albeit slightly unstable, ability to time travel. If she retrieves some	rare actinium crystals from the Jurassic time period, the result could be catastrophic.	The mission, quite simply, is to stop Morgana.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Expedition</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Time travel through the Jurassic	period proves to be a highly unstable proposition. The expedition involves the encounter	of various kinds of Jurassic beasts, burning lava, crumbling cliffs and dark jungles.	Our hero is successful in blocking off passage to the first cluster of actinium crystals.	The expedition continues with a hard fought battle in the underground T-rex caves.	Will Morgana reach the crystals before she can be stopped?</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Deliverance</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before leaving the Jurassic	time period, there is one more task at hand: Rescue the Grogs from the Kabala. Still	recovering from the spell Morgana placed on this tribe, the Grog people are quickly	being extinguished as hungry Kabala make a feast of them. The Kabala nest must be	destroyed. As a reward, critical information will be revealed by the Grog clan leader	regarding Mordred's visit to this time period and his meeting with Morgana.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Knighthood</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beginning on the Shores of	Camelot, a siege ignites against Camelot and the evil forces that control her. The	courtyard at the castle's main gate provides a helpful future pod. The pod is greatly	needed in the barrage of arrows flying down from the rampart. The courtyard battle	is long and hard fought, however Merlin will not teleport our hero into the castle	until the sorcerers are apprehended in the Caves of Merlin. <BR>	<BR>	Finally, within the castle corridors, the real battle ensues. One bloody scene after	another marks the adventures within Camelot. Upon discovery of the Enchanted Lake,	Excalibur is claimed. With brave persistence, Morgana's forces are eliminated, Camelot	is freed, and knighthood is earned.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Siege</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the battles with knights,	sorcerers and archers unfold, Merlin discovers that many of the sorcerers would prefer	to escape Morgana's evil clutches. They are searching for one brave soul who will	lead them to salvation. Winning the sorcerers over requires nothing less than invading	the Dark Forest and laying siege to the sorcerer's castle, both of which are occupied	by the evil archers. Some of the archers in the castle seem nearly invincible. What	could be the magic behind that? <BR>	<BR>	The castle is eventually conquered, and most of the sorcerers, greatly impressed,	abandon Morgana and join the forces of good. However, there exists a band of rogue	sorcerers who decide to stay with Morgana. These sorcerers must be hunted down in	the Tower of Malhechor. The tower presents a most eerie and unpredictable environment,	where evil seems to lurk behind every corner. Unlocking the mysteries of the tower	reveals a path to the top where the rogue sorcerers are met in a climatic battle.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Morgana'sLair</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With most of the remaining	sorcerers won over, Merlin teleports our hero to the evil forest surrounding Morgana's	castle, dark and treacherous, full of unwanted surprises. In the center of the forest	a secret cave leads to Morgana's castle. The castle is circled by a ring of fire	and heavily guarded by skull snakes and a Winged Fire Beast. The persistent assault	on her troops coupled with the invasion of her castle throws Morgana into a fury.	She becomes temporarily distracted from her plot to exploit the powers of the actinium	crystals, and instead focuses on hunting down the nuisance who has dared to step	foot into her domain. <BR>	<BR>	Successful in grabbing Morgana's attention, our hero escapes the castle with the	help of Merlin. Merlin's teleportation signal, however, is interrupted, and the teleport	destination is re-routed to a holding cell in the heart of Morgana's Lair. The cell,	enveloped by an intricate maze, is surrounded by the dark and perverse breeding grounds	of Morgana's magical beasts. So wicked are these creatures that it is no surprise	to discover that The Beast lords over the land. The sorcerers join the battle against	evil, and victory is won.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Nightmare</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Merlin opens the sleep chamber	for one final rest, but this time our hero experiences the worst nightmare yet. The	Beast unleashes its creatures within an ever-twisting maze of chaos, triggering every	fear imagineable. Confrontation of these fears in the dreamstate is a strategic move	by Merlin. The ability to confront and overcome them is a necessary skill for adventures	to follow.<BR>	<BR>	Our hero awakens on Kronos, and discovers first-hand the magnitude of forces attacking	the starship. Teleporting between Kronos and the Camelot time period, the next adventure	entails an invasion of the Temple of Dark Knights as well as slowing down the attacking	forces on Kronos. After these battles are won, Merlin reveals the more important	task at hand: Invading Mordred's domain, the Castle of Pain and Sorrows. <BR>	<BR>	The fight up the treacherous rocks of Graeden leads to Gabriel's Tower. Within the	tower the key which unlocks the secret tunnel to the Castle of Pain and Sorrows is	discovered. The castle is heavily fortified by Mordred's forces. The odds of winning	are overwhelming. The castle's lower dungeons hold many Quest Knights captured during	their search for the Holy Grail. The Quest Knights are freed, the Minister of Evil	is confronted, and the Charm of Making is revealed. Once the lower region of the	castle is cleared, Merlin teleports our hero to the upper towers of the castle. Here	lurk the strongest creatures of this time period, where the past and future come	together, and twisted and perverse magic empower the guardians of Mordred. The face-off	with Mordred and his guardians proves much more frightening than the nightmare.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Droids</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shaken by the attack on her	son, Morgana retreats to the future to plot her final revenge. Before going after	her, our hero must first return to Kronos to prevent Kronos technology from falling	into the wrong hands. With the ship's self-destruct activated, the race to secure	the ship and de-activate the self-destruct module begins. The battle includes a space	walk to the orbiter pad, a horrific fight in the science lab, and an extensive search	for the self-destruct shutdown switch. <BR>	<BR>	The success of this mission earns our hero a promotion from Federation Command. While	still on Kronos, our hero visits the ship's library and does research on the Anacreon	time period. This research provides much needed insight on the events to come.<BR>	<BR>	The next adventure involves travelling sidewards in time, to a place on Earth where	droids and sewer creatures roam the land. The place is the old WorldSoft region,	whose land was recently acquired by an unruly woman with an appetite for revenge.	Fighting through the war-torn streets leads to Morgana's headquarters. The security	system prevents entry past the headquarters lobby. In order to shutdown the security	system, the TABO security control center must first be disabled. Merlin teleports	our hero to the waters of Wysiwyg where Forraje, slain leader of the WorldSoft Empire,	once lived. Deactivating Forraje's old TABO security protocol reveals a passage to	the secret underground security control station.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Infiltration</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The underground security control	station operates the force fields throughout the old WorldSoft Empire, including	the shields securing Morgana's headquarters. The station is heavily guarded by Ground	Assault Troopers (GATs), Hover Troopers, Hover Bike Cops, and a pair of powerful	Suburban Patrol/Attack Mechas (SPAMs). Shutting down the primary shield generator	in the control station provides access to the headquarter elevators. The headquarters	are infiltrated by way of the Spewie infested sewer system which leads to the headquarter	boilder room. The battles surrounding the siege of headquarters are intense. Success	is achieved once both destruct switches are located and activated. <BR>	<BR>	Next is the infiltration of Morgana's droid-controlled manufacturing plants used	for mass production of mechanical military units (such as GATs and SPAMs). The plant	is guarded by creatures from all time periods. The Graviton Dynamo, where the switches	which control the plant reside, is most heavily guarded. The machinery in the Dynamo	also present a visual danger, as most organic creatures are unable to stomach the	mass chaos of moving parts. The success of shutting down the plant leaves just one	step between our hero and Morgana. In order to gain access to Morgana's flagship,	the Reina Siniestra, an access card must be retrieved from a remote space colony	known as The Keep. The Keep is guarded by just a few, albeit, extremely powerful	Stone Golem snipers.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Showdown</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Exploring the Reina Siniestra	uncovers an eerie presence, yet there is no sign of Morgana. After a few entanglements	with the forces on board the ship, a teleportation pod transports our hero to the	heart of Jahala, a city once inhabited by the work force of WorldSoft. The streets	are crawling with military units and exploding Forraje clones. The eastern region	of the city contains the primary power grid. Disabling the grid effectively cripples	the city. Unfortunately, disabling the grid also beckons the evil which lurks in	locked office buildings. The final showdown commences with one brave marine against	an onslaught of GATs, SPAMs, bike cops, laser turrets, and Mauvair and Morgana. Here,	in Jahala, Morgana makes her final stand. <BR>	<BR>	Once the city and the flagship are completely cleared, victory is hailed throughout	the quadrant. Merlin teleports our hero back to the Kronos starship and bids him	farewell. A new AI is discovered during the trip home. Merlin is gone. Three holodeck	programs are running, each a gift from Merlin to the one who stood against Morgana	and saved mankind.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#660066" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Epilogue</B></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Walking the corridors of Kronos	one last time, our hero feels a longing to be back with Merlin, in battle, conquering	evil, and experiencing chivalry at its finest. After three days in space, Kronos	approaches Earth. Our hero is transported down to the UEF Intelligence headquarters	to report for debriefing. Later our hero finds seclusion in the station's control	tower, overlooking miles of beautiful countryside. Again, thoughts drift off to castles,	knights and Merlin. Night falls like a heavy blanket upon the heart. <BR>	<BR>	Suddenly, as if in response to these thoughts, magnificent bursts of lightning split	the heavens. A section of dark clouds opens up, swallowing up nearby cloudbanks.	A blinding light explodes from the opening, illuminating everything in sight. The	storm is actually a rip in the space time continuum. Looking towards the sky, the	face of our hero relaxes, and as the storm subsides, so does the emptiness and sadness	that once weighed so heavy upon the heart. A comforting peace transcends the night.	Merlin is back in Camelot. Our hero recalls the magic and majesty of the previous	journeys, one brief shining moment in history, yet an epic adventure to remember	for all time.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="5"
