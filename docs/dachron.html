Dachronian technology became			viable in 2204 when scientists discovered new properties in fluid mechanics involving			the use of this new mineral. <BR>			<BR>			When the DOD (Department of Defense) ascertained the vast importance of this new			discovery and the impact it would have on weapons technology, they immediately seized			half of the Dachronia minerals surplus for secret government projects. Working with			LockMart-Boeing-DuPont engineers, the DOD developed a new metal from these minerals			that was lightweight, yet more durable than the hardest titanium alloy. It also emitted			very low friction heat. Taking advantage of this metal's unique properties, scientists			developed new high speed, high powered handheld weapons.<BR>			<BR>			By the year 2215, the government had perfected a highpowered rapid fire assault rifle:			the Dachron minigun. <BR>			<BR>			The Dachron minigun is an extraordinarily volatile weapon. It's creation was inspired			by the weapons known as miniguns that were used during the latter part of the twentieth			century. It was in the year 2032 when the United Nations &quot;Peaceable World Constitution&quot;			banned the use of such weapons. The basic design philosophy of the Dachron followed			that of its predecessors: The more firepower available to a soldier, the more likely			the enemy would suffer greater casualties. The Dachron, however, has an advantage			over its primitive counterparts. Where the minigun had only one firing chamber, the			Dachron contains thirteen. The gun consists of 13 revolving barrels. With 4 chambers			per barrel, the Dachron is capable of a full 52 rounds of shots before reload. The			two revolutionary aspects of the gun, however, are its very light weight given its			fire power, and its secondary trigger mechanism which allows all 13 barrels to expend			a shot simultaneously. This is an extremely lethal punch. It uses ammunition much			faster than the primary trigger, and as such it is advised that it not be used unless			under extreme duress. In general, one Dachron minigun is issued per platoon. <BR>			<BR>			As a matter of history, this secondary burst shot would prove to be highly effective			in the WorldSoft coup of 2258. Rebel executives obtained several Dachron miniguns			from the government and staged a coup unmatched by any in history. Kahnene Forraje,			WorldSoft's leader at the time, controlled an arsenal comparable to a second world			country, including a massive horde of self-destructing Forraje clones. With one burst			shot from the Dachron minigun, however, an entire room of Forraje clones could be			destroyed. Eventually Forraje's army was defeated, and new power took over WorldSoft.			Forraje himself was hunted down and executed with an ordinary Snyper pistol.</FONT>			</BLOCKQUOTE>		</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="150">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="140">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="100">&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR></FONT><A HREF="weapons.html"><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR>INDEX</FONT></A><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#BBBBBB" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Copyright&copy; 2000-2007, ExcaliburWorld Software</FONT></BODY></HTML>
