For decades, despite enormous advances in the			technology, the maximum muzzle velocities attainable were nowhere near what was believed			possible, and erosion continued to be a problem.  Railguns were confined to the laboratory			where rails were often removed and resurfaced due to hypervelocity erosion.  When			achieving high accelerations through electrical action between sliding contacts,			hypervelocity erosion is the rapid destruction of those contacts through arcing and			friction.<BR>			<BR>			Railguns differ from other means of accelerating objects in that the acceleration			in the rails occurs purely by magnetic repulsion. This magnetic force is termed a			&quot;Lorentz Force&quot;, and the most significant factor in determining the force			is the inductance gradient of the rails.  In a well designed Rail Gun, a gun with			a high inductance gradient, the most predominant factor in determining exit velocity			will always be the power supply current. Thus it follows that in order to produce			high muzzle velocities, long rails and/or very high currents must be used. Unfortunately,			maintaining a high current through a long pair of rails requires a lot of energy,			and with high currents, high rates of rail erosion are inevitable.<BR>			<BR>			Higher exit velocities are attainable with higher injection velocities.  With higher			injection velocities, the electrical arcing and ohmic heating between the projectile			and the rails will not have as much time to heat the rail surfaces to vaporization.			Thus, up to a certain point, a higher injection velocity will help minimize rail			damage. It also prevents rail/projectile spot welding, which can occur at zero injection			velocities and low powers on metal/metal contacts. Given the energy expenditure of			accelerating the projectile electrically, and the advantages of pre-injection, it			makes sense to impart as much initial velocity to the projectile as possible, and			only then allow the electric action to do what it is most effective at: attaining			velocities that would not be feasible with a gas injection mechanism alone.<BR>			 &nbsp;<BR>			Energy loss in a railgun is proportional to projectile momentum, and can be minimized			by increasing the induction gradient. This would imply that rail guns are most efficient			at accelerating light payloads. However, it has been shown experimentally that with			calibers less than 18mm, the efficiency of a railgun decreases with the smaller size			bores.<BR>			<BR>			In 2245, after enormous amounts of money had been invested in railgun technology,			a solution to the erosion problem was finally conceived by Worldsoft Laboratories.			Through significant improvements in the materials and design, Worldsoft invented			the first usable railgun called the Damocles.  The Damocles only achieved velocity			speeds of 1000m/s, and suffered a short life-cycle.  Over time, the railgun still			suffered magnetic field and velocity impacts.  Unfortunately, after the fall of Worldsoft,			advances on the Damocles came to a halt.<BR>			<BR>			In 2285, over 10 years after the introduction of the EMR4000 plasma missile launcher			and 60 years after the Damocles, the Federation announced a new railgun technology.			 Developed in the secret labs of the T9000 Starbase, the T9000 Railgun began being			deployed to Federation troops.  This remarkable weapon resolved several issues that			plagued past railgun designs.  The energy problem was resolved by using a Radon gas			power source.  The increase in power allowed for a manageable sized rail. Corrosion			was reduced to negligible amounts by using a combination of titanium and dachronian			metals.  Although the railgun is still in its infancy and costs an exorbitant amount			of money to produce, it is the favored weapon of most Federation cadets.<BR>			<BR>			The T9000 Railgun uses light weight titanium slugs sized perfectly to achieve the			maximum muzzle velocity.  The T9000 cartridge holds 26 slugs.<BR>			<BR>			The railgun uses Radon power to establish the magnetic field between the rails, providing			high velocity rapid-fire titanium trajectories.  <BR>			<BR>			Similar to the EMF4000, the T9000 uses an exhaust system to increase the life span			of the weapon.  Utilizing the exhaust tube, the T9000 incorporates a standard trigger			mechansim for launching T9000 grenades.  These grenades are activated once they hit			a target, starting a built-in 3-second timer fuse before igniting.</FONT>			</BLOCKQUOTE>		</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="150">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="140">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="100">&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR></FONT><A HREF="weapons.html"><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR>INDEX</FONT></A><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#BBBBBB" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Copyright&copy; 2000-2007, ExcaliburWorld Software</FONT></BODY></HTML>
