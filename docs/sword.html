Excalibur, the Sword			of Power, is a magical sword which rose from an enhanted lake during the Dark Ages.			It has special properties of being invincible, and can conjure up enough power to			emit lightning bursts when needed.</FONT>			</BLOCKQUOTE>			<P>			<BLOCKQUOTE>			<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First won by Lord			Uther, the sword was buried into a stone rock upon Uther's fall from kingship. For			years the sword stood cemented in the stone, and the land was without a king. The			sorcerer Merlin foretold the coming of a new king who would free Excalibur and unite			the land. The new king, of course, was King Arthur. Upon freeing the sword, Arthur			became king, and peace and prosperity spread through the lands. <BR>			<BR>			During Arthur's reign, Camelot was built, and the Knights of the Round Table came			to be. While the sorcerer Merlin was guiding the king, Arthur's half-sister Morgana			began dabbling in the art of black magic. When King Arthur discovered that Camelot's			greatest knight, Sir Lancelot, was having an affair with the queen, with unbearable			anguish he thrust Excalibur into the earth. Once again, the land was without a king.			In a moment of desparation, Merlin revealed the Charm of Making to Morgana. Morgana			seized the opportunity and used the charm against Merlin to imprison him for all			eternity in a pillar of ice. <BR>			<BR>			Morgana began her rampage, using the charm to conceive a child with Arthur. She bore			a son, Mordred, whom she protected with magical armor. Mauvair, her master wizard,			also protected and trained Mordred as he grew. In time, the evil trio threatened			to conquer King Arthur and take Camelot. <BR>			<BR>			While the queen kept Excalibur safely hidden, the Quest Knights set out in search			of the Holy Grail. Though the grail was never found, Percival discovered the secret			of the grail, Arthur regained what was lost, and a final battle scene ensued where			Arthur, wielding Excalibur, joined with Lancelot and his other knights to defeat			Mordred and his armies. This, however, is where history begins to re-write itself.<BR>			<BR>			Ancient history records chronicle the above accounts, but recently discovered records			reveal an entirely different outcome. The change appears to have occurred after an			experimental time travel expedition which took place in 2270. The experiment disrupted			the space time continuum. The crew conducting the experiment lacked understanding			of the forces they were dealing with. No precautions were taken, and the result was			a breach in the time line. Due to new accounts written during the time of Camelot,			it is believed that this experiment ripped through the continuum connected with the			period of Camelot, and ignited an electrical storm. <BR>			<BR>			Earlier records indicated that the spirit of Merlin influenced the outcome of events,			including a visit to Morgana which caused her to loose her youth. Mordred is believed			to have killed his mother in disgust, and to have later lost his life in the battle			scene that took place with Arthur and his knights. Mordred could only be killed by			the magical powers of Excalibur, which Arthur wielded in battle. <BR>			<BR>			However, later records indicate that after the great electrical storm of the Dark			Ages, Merlin was never seen again, in reality or in dreams. Because of this, Morgana			lived. After Arthur and his knights defeated Mordred's armies, Mordred and Morgana			escaped. They remained in seclusion for decades that followed. <BR>			<BR>			Many years after the battle, people throughout the land began reporting odd occurrences.			Goats and sheep were disappearing without a trace. Children would return home with			strange markings engraved upon their flesh, having no recollection of how they were			put there. <BR>			<BR>			By order of the king, scouts went on special alert. Kirin, a Ranger of the Enchanted			Forest, and one of Arthur's most skilled archers, was a scout stationed near the			edge of Lake Gallion. One night in her sleep, she dreamt of the Lady of the Lake.			The dream, however, turned into a nightmare when the Lady's face became distorted,			mutating into another form: Morgana. The nightmare woke her, and as she rose she			could hear a thunderous roar coming from the other side of the lake. Not knowing			what it was, she had a strong sense of foreboding. Something terrible was about to			happen.<BR>			<BR>			After years of concealing herself in the Dark Forest, The Sorceress Morgana had come			out of hiding. With her master wizard Mauvair and her son Mordred at her side, she			led a force so powerful that entire towns were destroyed in a single day. Her attacks			were executed with such speed that many never awoke from their sleep to witness the			blood and mayhem. Her timing was perfect. Arthur was disabled with a mysterious illness,			and many of his best knights were far away still in search of the Holy Grail. Morgana's			magic dried up streams, turned lakes into lava pools, and withered crops to dust.			<BR>			<BR>			At the climax of the bloodshed, Morgana and Mauvair overtook and fortified the Mannenhaum			stronghold near the base of the mountain on which Camelot stood. Arthur sent scores			of knights, archers and sorcerors to fight against Morgana and her black magic, but			it was hopeless. The scene at Mannenhaum was the worst massacre in Camelot's history.			The Ranger Kirin was the only one to escape alive.<BR>			<BR>			Kirin returned to Camelot with the horrific details of the massacre, and warned Arthur			of the impending attack on Camelot itself. Realizing the impossibility of fighting			off this attack, Arthur organized an escape with those remaining in the castle. Kirin			returned to the Enchanted Forest to help those who were still free of Morgana's clutches.			Noticeably absent from the scene was Merlin. In fact, he had not been seen for months.			<BR>			<BR>			After Morgana besieged Camelot, she began a diabolical new undertaking... one that			reached beyond the boundaries of her new kingdom, beyond the boundaries of her world,			and beyond the boundaries of time. Because of an ill-conceived and poorly planned			experiment with time travel, the outcome of the past was changed, and now the survival			of mankind was in jeopardy.<BR>			<BR>			Circa 2289, a wicked series of attacks were made on outposts and space colonies throughout			the galaxy. Every platoon put in action was beaten back by space pirates. Federation			Command decided to try a different approach. They would choose one brave marine to			infiltrate the pirate raids. By utilizing only one marine, the Federation was far			less conspicuous. If the marine failed, the loss of one would justify the salvation			of thousands. Fortunately for the Federation, they picked the right marine, and the			space pirates were defeated. The leader of the pirate raids, known as the Devil in			a Blue Dress, was destroyed. Sensor readings taken from their pirate ship, the El			Diablo, showed signs of time travel. Further investigations showed a greater force			behind the pirate raids, a force which originated from the Camelot period. Thanks			to modern man breaking the boundaries of time, Morgana survived and, in time, discovered			a means of time traveling herself. <BR>			<BR>			In 2290, a desperate Federation recruited the same marine who defeated the space			pirates to hunt down and destroy Morgana. The marine thought of it as just one more			assignment. Federation Command, however, knew it was much more. They needed to repair			the damage caused by their time travelling experiments and were acutely aware that			the odds were no longer in their favor. In order to correct the disruption to the			time line, one of the tasks would be to locate the sword Excalibur and use it to			destroy Mordred. <BR>			<BR>			These are the latest accounts regarding Excalibur. As of yet, there are no reports			depicting either success or failure of this mission.</FONT>			</BLOCKQUOTE>		</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="150">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="140">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="30">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="100">&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR></FONT><A HREF="weapons.html"><FONT FACE="Arial, Geneva, Helvetica"><BR>INDEX</FONT></A><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#BBBBBB" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Copyright&copy; 2000-2007, ExcaliburWorld Software</FONT></BODY></HTML>
