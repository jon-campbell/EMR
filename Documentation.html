<div id="content">EMR 3.0 is a unique scenario based upon the Aleph
One (Marathon) engine. It is a first-person action adventure game,
featuring an epic and in-depth story line. As a Federation Marine
resting after your last mission, you start aboard the exploration
class Starship Kronos where you learn that your real mission has
yet to begin. You are re-acquainted with the AI Merlin, who
introduces you to Kronos time traveling technology, and reveals
your new mission: to save mankind from the clutches of Morgana and
her minions. Through untamed raptor-infested jungles, castle
arenas, and war-torn streets of the future, you will wield weapons
from all time periods - including the Sword of Power, Excalibur -
in an effort to thwart the diabolical plot that unfolds. The EMR
adventure, spread across 42 solo levels, weaves a tale of truth and
honor, knighthood and bravery, and darkness and treachery. EMR also
delivers 27 adrenaline pumped network levels. EMR immerses you in
an amazing new world, creating an addictive, fun and unique gaming
experience.<br>
<br>
For those that played EMR under the old Marathon Infinity engine,
EMR 3.0 brings exciting new maps, new high resolution textures and
landscapes, a completely new set of weapons, new monsters and
friends, new scenery, new 16-bit sounds, original music, and a
carefully woven original story line that transcends time. Using the
Aleph One engine, EMR now sports loads of new special features
using Aleph One's MML and Lua scripting languages. Please note that
the AlephOne engine is old technology improved. Architecture is
still simulated 3D, so there are no ramps, bridges, and balconies,
nor horizontal doors. The sprites in EMR are made up of 2D images
posed in different views, not 3D models. Do not expect the latest
state-of-the-art graphics engine, but you can expect an intriguing
storyline, creative map architectures, engaging graphics, original
spellbinding music, and mood-setting sound effects.<br>
